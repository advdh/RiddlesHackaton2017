Round 49: if we sacrifice (11,11), then win immediately

General: Use Parameter.WinBonus (based on MaxWinBonus and WinBonusDecrementFactor) also for calculating Score2 after simulation

Round 100: passmove? Partly solved in v42. BUT: the only move which does not lead to loss is not in the move candidates!
After solving that (v42): Best move is birthmove (4,5) (4,2) (7,4), but there are two issues:
- This birthmore is not in the move candidates: because birth (4,5) is ranked 13th in the births ranking. Birth moves are
	only generated for the first 3 births for this low number of own fields (4). TODO: find a way to generate more birth moves
	in case we have only a few own fields.
	Idea: add additional birth moves as follows: for each pair of kills, try to find births, which protect the remaining own fields
	(prevent them from being removed because of lonelyness or suffocation)
- Even if the birthmove is added to the move candidates, then it is not getting the highest score of all move candidates.
	That's because the simulator is not smart enough to generate winning moves for the opponent for other move candidates.
	Solution: turn off smartsimulator (parms.SmartMoveGenerationCount = 0): only if we have few fields? or also if opponent has few fields?
