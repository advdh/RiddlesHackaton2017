Exception handling: log as much data as possible and return PassMove

To improve replayability, use a seed for randomization, based on first board.
	Write this seed to the log.
	Recreate the Random object every round based on this seed, 
	so that even timing differences do not influence the randomization

MonteCarlo with max. duration: increase count and simulation count at the same time
while (!timeToStop)
{
	for all previous moves: add one more simulation
	generate new move, and simulate it <count> times
}
pick one with best statistics
