Fixed KillMove when we are about to win:
- if opponent has exactly one cell
DONE V8

Don't try Birthmoves, of which the new born cell has no neighbours at all: it will die immediately
Note that it may be worth to select a new born cell with exactly one own neighbour: it will also die immediately,
but it may keep the neighbour alive
DONE V8

Don't try Killmoves to kill our own cells
DONE V8

Score: include average number of rounds to win, because score is often 100%. Less rounds to win is better.
DONE V10

To improve replayability, use a seed for randomization, based on first board.
	Write this seed to the log.
	Recreate the Random object every round based on this seed, 
	so that even timing differences do not influence the randomization

Fixed KillMove when we are about to win:
- if opponent has two or more cells, which can be killed all by one Kill- or BirthMove

If opponent has few cells left, then try all kill moves instead of 
	picking random kill moves

Select best moves, based on direct impact statistics
	Improve calculation speed of direct impact statistics

MonteCarlo with max. duration: increase count and simulation count at the same time
while (!timeToStop)
{
	for all previous moves: add one more simulation
	generate new move, and simulate it <count> times
}
pick one with best statistics

If only squares of 4 left, which do not touch, then draw (Nash equilibrium). 
They fall apart if you try to add anything, especially if you can only sacrifice the square's cells.
