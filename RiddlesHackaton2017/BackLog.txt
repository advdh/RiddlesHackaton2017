Fixed KillMove when we are about to win:
- if opponent has exactly one cell
- try all kill moves and pick best if he has only a few cells left

Don't try Birthmoves, of which the new born cell has no neighbours at all: it will die immediately
Note that it may be worth to select a new born cell with exactly one own neighbour: it will also die immediately,
but it may keep the neighbour alive

Select best moves, based on direct impact statistics
	Improve calculation speed of direct impact statistics

MonteCarlo with max. duration: increase count and simulation count at the same time
while (!timeToStop)
{
	for all previous moves: add one more simulation
	generate new move, and simulate it <count> times
}
pick one with best statistics
