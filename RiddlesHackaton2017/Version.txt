V9	30-10-2017, 07:56	Fixed System.IndexOutOfRangeException
V10	30-10-2017, 09:28	Include average number of rounds to win/loose in score

V12	01-11-2017, 23:18	Improved move generation
V13	04-11-2017, 01:45	Monte-Carlo simulations: no more birth moves if player has very few cells
V14	04-11-2017, 12:24	Monte-Carlo move generation: board score is based on two generations ahead
V15	04-11-2017, 19:06	Bugfixes end game: kill moves were not simulated if we had very few cells left
						+ simulation that both players lost their last cells was not handled correctly
						+ 20% performance improvement
V20	07-11-2017, 23:04	New move generator: takes best of (100 best birth moves + all kill moves) 
						+ 92% performance improvement calculation of births and kills
V21 08-11-2017, 20:00	CheatBot test version: cheats by sacrificing the same cell twice
V22	11-11-2017, 16:02	Move generator orders by real gain2 + several bugfixes in calculating gain2
V23	11-11-2017, 16:21	Bugfix: gain2 of PassMove is always 0
V24 12-11-2017, 19:00	Bugfix BotParser: reset Board.NextGeneration
						Bugfix CalculateBoardStatus: also recalculate mofified field board1
V25	13-11-2017, 09:33	Score calculation: give win bonus to moves if opponent has 8 or less cells left, next and/or nextnext round, negative if it's me
						Precalculated NeighboursAndMe
V26	13-11-2017, 18:59	MoveGenerator: two bugfixes in score calculation
V27	14-11-2017, 22:10	Count generations rather than moves
						Monte Carlo simulations performance improvement by applying move to the current board
						Changed WinBonus: if me and/or opponent <= 13 cells left
V28	19-11-2017, 11:56	New smart move simulator: applicable first 4 generations if at least one of the players
						has at most 15 fields left
						Pick best move, based on unrounded total number of wingenerations (rather than rounded average number)
						Bugfix win/loose rounds
						Max. simulations = 30: draw if relative difference is smaller than 2.0
V29	19-11-2017, 14:34	Decrease simulation count if limited time
						Use max. 20% of available timebank
V30	19-11-2017, 15:21	Bugfix: don't exclude births with score <= 0
V31	19-11-2017, 17:24	Turn off smart simulation: it's too slow and therefore leads to timeouts
V32	19-11-2017, 19:20	Bugfix simulator, and reenable SmartMove simulator with SmartMoveGenerationCount = 4 (previously it was effectively infinite)
V33	21-11-2017, 22:08	Use max. 10% of remaining time + don't use SmartMoveSimulator if max. allowed duration < 80 ms (timebank < 800 ms)
V35 06-12-2017, 23:17	Parallellized simulations + start with 25 simulations, increase max to 50
V36 08-12-2017, 12:55	Catch and ignore aggregate exceptions in parallell part
V37 09-12-2017, 13:50	Use Troschuetz random generator
V37.1 05-03-2018, 08:30	Parameter WinBonusDecrementFactor = 0.916, based on simulation results
V38	06-03-2018, 09:30	Parameter SimulationMaxGenerationCount = 5, based on simulation results
V39	07-03-2018, 07:30	New Parameter BinarySimulationResult = false with SimulationMaxGenerationCount = 8, based on simulation results
V40 07-03-2018, 11:43	Bugfix Score2 calculation: Score2 was not calculated in case of immediate win or loose
						Possible bugfix: possibly fixed NullReferenceException
						New parameter ParallelSimulation
						SimulationCount vs. MoveCount optimized based on simulations: 2-13, MinSimulationCount = 1, StartSimulationCount = 13, MaxSimulationCount in practice not used anymore
V41 08-03-2018, 23:48	Removed parameter BinarySimulationResult, added parameter SimulationFactor
						Set parameter StartSimulationCount = 25, MinSimulationCount = 1, MaxSimulationCount = 50, remove SimulationCount vs. MoveCount optimization
V42 09-03-2018, 22:00	Bugfix round 100: Did always a pass in round 100
						Bugfix score 2: include board score of candidate moves in score2
						Bugfix non-parallel simulation: did not calculate score2
V43 10-03-2018, 11:00	Bugfix move generation: for passmove the winbonus was not added to the score. Therefore in many cases, passmove was the first evaluated move
V44	12-03-2018, 17:00	WinBonusDecrementFactor = 0.940, based on simulation results
						Split MaxWinBonus and WinBonusDecrementFactor in two, but no changes
						New parameter ScoreBasedOnWinBonus, but no changes
V45	12-03-2018, 19:28	Bugfix (2) move generation: for passmove the winbonus was not multiplied with the WinBonusWeight. Therefore in many cases, passmove was still the first evaluated move
